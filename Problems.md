## Problems Encountered and Solutions

### 1. **Issue**: Jenkins Pipeline Failure
- **Description**: The Jenkins pipeline occasionally failed due to misconfigured build steps (using wrong war name ).
- **Solution**: Reviewed and updated the configuration in pom.xml to ensure all steps were correctly defined and dependencies were met. Added error handling and notifications for better visibility.

### 2. **Issue**: Tomcat Deployment Issues
- **Description**: Applications were not deploying correctly to Tomcat due to incorrect configuration.
- **Solution**: Verified Tomcat configuration files and deployment descriptors. Ensured correct paths and permissions were set. Re-deployed the application after fixing configuration issues.

### 3. **Issue**: CodeDeploy Deployment Failures
- **Description**: CodeDeploy failed to deploy due to incorrect script_path in appspec.yml.
- **Solution**: Modified the appspec.yml and pushed it to the S3 bucket and ensured that the deployment script in CodeDeploy was properly configured. Validated deployment settings and retries.

### 4. **Issue**: Load Balancer Health Check Failures
- **Description**: Load balancer health checks failed, causing instances to be marked as unhealthy.
- **Solution**: Reviewed and adjusted health check settings to ensure they accurately reflect the application's health. Verified that instances were correctly serving traffic.

### 5. **Issue**: Auto Scaling Group Issues
- **Description**: The correct Auto Scaling group did not targetted by LoadBalancer.
- **Solution**: Rectified the target groups of LoadBalancer and then tried again for the deployment.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined above and addressing the problems encountered, the Jenkins pipeline, Tomcat server, AWS CodeDeploy, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling Group were successfully set up to ensure a robust CI/CD pipeline and scalable application deployment.
